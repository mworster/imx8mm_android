Setup Android on the i.MX8M mini EVK
====================================

This document covers how to setup the i.MX8Mmini for Android OS/Development. Most of this information exists in the wild in numerious different places, 
but this centeralized document will strive to be more succent as well as point out various pitfalls that developers will find. 

In order to build for the i.MX--- series, you really need a Linux distribution. Ideally you'd be building/working directly off a Linux machine. However, if
as in my case right now, this is not possible, then your best bet is to install/use WSL on windows.
